    "**Explanation**: The **contact_matrix** function in R facilitates the creation of contact matrices from survey data of Horby 2005 (semi-rural setting), offering capabilities for age group customization, age-based weighting, and the application of various filters to enhance the analysis. It processes survey data from Vietnam with specified age brackets (0, 5, 15, 35, 50, 70) and employs age weighting (weigh.age = TRUE), accounting for the age distribution of the Vietnamese population and calculating the average number of daily contacts for each age category. The age distribution is aligned with Vietnam's population as of 2020.\n",
    "Given that Horby's original dataset includes only age groups rather than the precise ages of participants, this process attempts to assign a specific age within each age group and conducts bootstrap sampling a thousand times (n = 1000), averaging the results from these samples.\n",
    "The outcome is a total count of daily contact matrix for all locations. To obtain the ultimate results, each matrix value has been scaled up by a factor of 365.25."
